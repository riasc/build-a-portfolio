Illustration of common responsive flexbox layouts:
* [flexbox/flexbox.html](./flexbox/flexbox.html) implements the flexbox layout illustrating the order property for rearranging the order of the sections.
Breakpoint that changes the order of the layout has been implemented at 700px. Working demo can be found

* [flexbox/columndrop.html](./patterns/columndrop.html) implements the responsive
column drop flexbox pattern. Initially, the layout starts with three sections that are aligned one after another. Breakpoints at 450px and 550px ensure that the sections will not shrink when resizing and instead the section will moved on top of one another.
