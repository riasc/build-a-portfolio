Illustration of the most common responsive flexbox layouts that reside inside
the [`./flexbox`](./flexbox) folder and described in the following:
* [`./flexbox/flexbox.html`](./flexbox/flexbox.html) implements the flexbox layout illustrating the order property for rearranging the order of the sections.
Breakpoint that changes the order of the layout has been implemented at `700px`. Demo can be found [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/riasc/build-a-portfolio/blob/master/flexbox/flexbox.html)

* [`./flexbox/columndrop.html`](./flexbox/columndrop.html) implements the responsive
column drop flexbox pattern. Initially, the layout starts with three sections that are aligned one after another. Breakpoints at `450px` and `550px` ensure that the sections will not shrink when resizing and instead the section will be moved on top of one another.
Demo can be found [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/riasc/build-a-portfolio/blob/master/flexbox/columndrop.html).

* [`./flexbox/mostlyfluid.html`](./flexbox/mostlyfluid.html) implements the responsive
mostlyfluid flexbox pattern. At its narrowest viewport the layout is stacked, but as the
layout gets wider the grid pattern starts to appear. Once the layout hits its largest
viewport, instead of expanding, margins are added to the left and the right. Breakpoints are set at `450px`, `550px` and `700px`. Demo can be found [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/riasc/build-a-portfolio/blob/master/flexbox/mostlyfluid.html). `[./flexbox/pattern-mostly-fluid-quiz-blankcss.html`](./flexbox/pattern-mostly-fluid-quiz-blankcss.html`) depicts a mostly fluid layout with more segments.

* [`./flexbox/layoutshifter.html`](./flexbox/layoutshifter.html) implements the
responsive layoutshifter flexbox pattern. At the beginning (width less than 500px)
this layout has the sections stacked on top of one another. Breakpoints at 500px and
600px allow the content to move about. Demo can be found [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/riasc/build-a-portfolio/blob/master/flexbox/layoutshifter.html).

* [`./flexbox/offcanvas.html`](./flexbox/offcanvas.html) implements the responsive offcanvas flexbox pattern. Instead of stacking content vertically, less frequently
used content (e.g., navigation) off screen only showing them if the screen is large
enough (greater than `300px`). Demo can be found [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/riasc/build-a-portfolio/blob/master/flexbox/offcanvas.html).
